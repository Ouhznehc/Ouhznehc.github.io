## About Me

I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student from [Kuang Yaming Honors School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn). 



## Research Interests

- **Operating Systems:** System Security & System Design.
- **Software Engineering:** Software Verification & Software Testing.

As AI continues to permeate all aspects of technology, the prevalence of AI-generated systems and software introduces new challenges in system security and software correctness. My research focuses on how to design systems that are well-suited for AI, while ensuring their robustness and security. This includes understanding how to verify the correctness of software generated by AI, and implementing measures that prevent unsafe AI-driven code from compromising system integrity. I am also exploring how programming languages can be optimized for systems programming in this context. Recently, I began studying [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html), as I believe it holds significant promise for the future of secure, reliable systems programming.

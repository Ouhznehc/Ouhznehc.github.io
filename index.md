## About Me

Iâ€™m a 3rd-year undergraduate student from [Kuang Yaming Honors School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn). 



## Research Interests

- **Operation Systems:** System Security & System Design.
- **Software Engineering:** Software Verification & Code Generationâ€‹.

AI is taking our jobs away. In this era of AI dominance, what should our role be? I am exploring how to design AI-friendly operating systems and how to verify the correctness of AI-generated code. It is crucial to understand how we can prevent unsafe AI-generated code from affecting system security. I am also curious about designing more complex programming languages with stricter constraints to reduce bugs at compile-time and more precisely define program execution. Additionally, I am keen to learn how AI can be used to write such sophisticated code for us. Balancing the opportunities and risks of AI, itâ€™s essential to develop frameworks that ensure AI contributions remain beneficial and secure.
